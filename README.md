## Packages Brought By The IExpX Compiler Project

*a set of inter-dependent Node packages*:
- `iexpx-compiler-chain` - *the minimum set of libs for some tasks, (a) eval-ing a string, (b) analysing a tree of src-files, and then either immediately execute, or emit machine-executables for further external handling*
- `iexpx-compiler-fwcore` - *the common/shared part of the FW (IEXPX), which is specific to the FW (ie not a "utils" library)*
- `commons` - *a "utils" library meant for possible use by unrelated libraries*
